# Movie Ticket Booking Chatbot using Google Cloud Dialogflow CX
# Introduction:
The project is to book cinema tickets online. The Ticket Reservation System is an Internet-based application that can be accessed throughout the internet and can be accessed by anyone who has a net connection. This application will reserve the tickets. This online ticket reservation system provides a website for a cinema hall where any user of the internet can access it. The user is required to log in to the system and needs a credit card for booking the tickets. Tickets can be collected at the counter and watching movies with family and friends in theatres is one of the best mediums of entertainment after having a hectic schedule. But all this excitement vanishes after standing hours in long queues to get tickets booked. The website provides complete information regarding currently running movies on all the screens with details of show timings and available seats. Ticket reservations are done using a credit card and can be canceled if needed. Our online ticket reservation system is one of the best opportunities for those who cannot afford enough time to get their tickets reserved standing in long queues. People can book tickets online at any time of day or night. Our reservation system also provides an option to cancel the tickets which are reserved previously.
